# Flip-Flop Machine Simulator

This web page simulates a particular machine built from [DEC Laboratory Digital Modules](dec-modules).

You can wire and simulate your own machine, and view and copy machines that others have built.

This simulator simulates the following modules:

- *Type 110 Diode Gate module*, consisting of two diode gates and two clamped load terminals.
- *Type 201 Flip-Flop module*, consisting of one flip-flop, two inverters, and three ground terminals.
([See a picture ][history:flip-flop] at the Computer History Museum.)
- *Type 401 Clock module.*
- *Type 5402 Clock module.*
- *Type 602 Pulse Amplifier module*, consisting of two pulse amplifiers, two inverters, and three grounds.
([See a picture][history:pulse-amplifier] of the similar of a Type 3602 Pulse Amplifier at the Computer History Museum.)

Why this project, and why machine configuration? All to be revealed in the fullness of time.
